# 🧠 Face Recognition-Based Attendance System 🎓

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that uses **Face Recognition**, **MTCNN**, and **OpenCV** to automate attendance tracking through facial identification. Users (admin/staff) can upload a group photo, and the app will detect known faces and mark attendance accordingly.

## 📸 Features

* 👥 Detects multiple faces in group images
* 🔐 Login system for authorized access
* 📁 Upload group images for real-time attendance
* ✅ Marks attendance as *Present* or *Absent*
* 🗓️ Generates timestamped attendance records
* 📊 View total attendance summary for each student
* 📤 Download full attendance report as CSV
* 🧾 View registered students and their images
